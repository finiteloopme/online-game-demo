# Overview
This is a demo built to highlight how to _externalise_ security in a micro services environment.  

We will use [Anthos Service Mesh][2] to demonstrate security at:
1. Transport layer: _Service A_ can trust _Service B_
2. Scope or API: A user request claim to perform a specific action

# Pre-requisites
Project setup is captured [here][1].
